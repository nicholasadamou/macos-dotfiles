# Open new iTerm window from the command line using v3 syntax for applescript as needed in iTerm2 Version 3+
# This script blocks until the cmd is executed in the new iTerm2 window.  It then leaves the window open.

# See also https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-scripting.html
#
# Note that the name "iTerm" may need to be changed to "iTerm2" in the AppleScript script for this to work.
#
# Usage:
#     iterm                   Opens the current directory in a new iTerm window
#     iterm [PATH]            Open PATH in a new iTerm window
#     iterm [CMD]             Open a new iTerm window and execute CMD
#     iterm [PATH] [CMD]      Opens a new iTerm window @ the PATH and executes CMD
#
# Example:
#     iterm ~/Code/HelloWorld ./setup.sh
